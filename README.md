* Fist of all, I'd like to thank you for the oportunity, hope these pieces of code find you well
* I've done this application avoiding the most of BDUF as possible. Code is simple, but it's Open-Closed from its roots. 
Some functions would be optimized when needed. 
* I usually avoid comments on code, which should be self-explained, but in this case, comments will rise on 
points I think could be improved if an application as this one would scale.
* For the sake of the time taken to setup and analyse the code, I'll commit `.env` and put frontend and backend in the same repository to make things easier. Even knowing it's not a good practice and highly unrecommended.
